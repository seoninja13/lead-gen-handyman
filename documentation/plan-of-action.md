# Handyman v2 Project Plan of Action

**Phase 1: FindHouse Template Setup (Completed)**
1. Explore the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse` directory to understand the structure of the FindHouse template.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for the FindHouse application by running `yarn install` in the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse` directory.
3. Start the original FindHouse application in development mode using the command `yarn dev` in the same `findhouse` directory and verify it is running correctly.

**Phase 2: Template Adaptation and Handyman Content Integration (In Progress)**
1. Replace the hero image on the home page with a handyman-related image, preserving the existing layout and CSS.
2. Replace placeholder content in the "Featured Properties" section with handyman-specific content, referencing the data model and URL structure defined in the documentation.
3. Customize the UI/UX to align with the Handyman brand and user experience goals.
4. Adapt existing components within the `components` directory to display handyman-specific information.

**Phase 3: Supabase Integration for Handyman Data**
1. Set up the Supabase database with tables for `businesses`, `services`, `cities`, `reviews`, and `bookings` as described in `handyman-v2/documentation/handyman-v2-documentation.md`.
2. Ensure the Supabase client in `utils/supabase/client.ts` is correctly configured with your Supabase credentials from `.env.local`.
3. Implement CRUD operations for core entities (businesses, services, cities, reviews, and bookings).

**Phase 4: Iterative Refinement and Feature Expansion**
1. Thoroughly test the application and fix any bugs or issues that arise during development.
2. Implement SEO best practices as outlined in `handyman-v2/documentation/handyman-v2-documentation.md`.
3. Explore and implement future features like OpenAI integration, advanced search filters, and user account functionality as needed.
