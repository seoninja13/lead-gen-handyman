# Development Progress

## OpenAI Content Generation (Last Updated: Feb 6, 2025)

### Current Status
- ✅ All existing city services have SEO content populated (mostly)
- ✅ Script `scripts/populate-city-service.ts` is working and ready for future use
- ✅ New city services will automatically get content generated when script is run
- ⚠️  TypeScript errors are present in `scripts/populate-city-service.ts` related to accessing properties of cities and services objects, but the script is still functional and generating content.
- ✅ OpenAI API call is verified and returning valid responses.
- ✅ Supabase update operation is verified and executing successfully.
- ✅ Script `scripts/run-populate-city-service.js` has been tested multiple times and runs without crashing.
- ⚠️ Rows 1603 and 1604 in the `city_services` table are empty and require further investigation.

### Implementation Details
1. Content Generation Script
   - Location: `scripts/populate-city-service.ts`
   - Purpose: Generates SEO content using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model
   - Generated Content:
     * SEO metadata (title, description, H1)
     * Content sections (main, features, benefits)
     * Service area content
     * FAQ content (JSON format)
     * Testimonials (JSON format)
     * Structured data
     * California-specific info

2. Required Environment Variables
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ```

### How to Run
1. Ensure environment variables are set in `.env.local`
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   npx tsc scripts/populate-city-service.ts --esModuleInterop --skipLibCheck --module ESNext --moduleResolution node --outDir build/scripts
   node build/scripts/populate-city-service.js
   ```

### Next Steps
1. Potential Improvements:
   - [ ] Add error handling for specific OpenAI API errors
   - [ ] Add retry logic for failed API calls
   - [ ] Add dry-run mode to preview changes
   - [ ] Add logging to track which records were updated
   - [ ] Add validation for the generated content

2. Maintenance Tasks:
   - [ ] Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs
   - [ ] Periodically review and update content generation prompts
   - [ ] Consider implementing content versioning

### Known Issues
- TypeScript errors in `scripts/populate-city-service.ts` related to accessing properties of `cities` and `services` objects.
- Rows 1603 and 1604 in the `city_services` table are empty.

### Dependencies
- OpenAI API (GPT-3.5 Turbo model)
- Supabase for database operations
- TypeScript for type safety

## Instructions for New Developer

### Investigating TypeScript Errors
- The script `scripts/populate-city-service.ts` currently has TypeScript errors related to accessing properties of `cities` and `services` objects.
- These errors should be investigated and resolved to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- Although the script is running with these errors, fixing them is important for long-term stability and to prevent potential issues in the future.
- Focus on understanding why the script is throwing TypeScript errors when accessing `name` property of `cities` and `services` objects, even though the script is running and generating content.
- Review the types and interfaces for `cities` and `services` objects to identify any discrepancies.

### Investigating Empty Rows 1603 and 1604
- Rows 1603 and 1604 in the `city_services` table are currently empty.
- This issue needs further investigation to determine why these rows were not populated correctly.
- It's possible that there might be an issue with the data for these specific rows in the `cities` or `services` tables, or with the script's logic in handling these specific cases.
- Check the script logs (if any) and Supabase database to understand the cause of this issue.
- Consider manually checking the data for city and service IDs corresponding to rows 1603 and 1604 to see if there are any inconsistencies or missing information.

### Running the Script
- To run the script and generate content for new city services, follow these steps:
  1. Ensure environment variables are set in `.env.local` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
  2. Run the script using the following commands:
     ```bash
     npx tsc scripts/populate-city-service.ts --esModuleInterop --skipLibCheck --module ESNext --moduleResolution node --outDir build/scripts
     node build/scripts/populate-city-service.js
     ```

### Verifying Script Execution in Supabase
- After running the script, verify that the `city_services` table in Supabase is updated correctly.
- Check for new rows and ensure that the content is generated as expected.
- Pay special attention to rows 1603 and 1604 to see if they are populated after investigation and fixes.
