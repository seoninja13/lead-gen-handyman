To start working on the Handyman project, navigate to the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-fdkNKA8O-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse` directory. This is the new project built with Next.js, Supabase, and OpenAI.

A new developer should read the following files in this order:
1. handyman-v2/new-developer-instructions.md
2. project-requirements.md
3. handyman-v2/documentation/handyman-v2-documentation.md
4. NEXT_STEPS.md
