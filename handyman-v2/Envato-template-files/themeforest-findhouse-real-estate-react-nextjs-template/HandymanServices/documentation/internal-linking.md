# Internal Linking Strategy

## Hierarchy Structure
```mermaid
graph TD
    Home --> Services
    Services --> ServiceCategory
    ServiceCategory --> Location
    Location --> Business
```

## Linking Rules
- Business Pages: Link upward to Location+Service
- Location Pages: Link to Service+Businesses
- Service Pages: Link to Related Services

## Implementation Workflow
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Define Service Taxonomy] --> B[Create URL Structure]
    B --> C[Implement Breadcrumbs]
    C --> D[Add Contextual Links]
    D --> E[Validate Link Hierarchy]
```
