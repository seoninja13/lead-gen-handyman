# Handyman Lead Generation - Verification System

This document describes the verification system implemented for the Handyman Lead Generation application.

## Overview

The verification system consists of several components:

1. **Status Tracking in Documentation**
   - Each task in tracking-progress.md includes a status column
   - Verification methods and results are documented

2. **Verification Checklist**
   - verification.md contains a comprehensive checklist of all components
   - Status is updated after each verification

3. **Automated Testing**
   - Cypress E2E tests verify critical functionality
   - Tests run automatically or manually as needed

4. **Issue Tracking System**
   - issues.md tracks known problems and their resolution
   - Each issue includes root cause and verification steps

5. **Component Status Dashboard**
   - component-status.md provides a visual overview of all components
   - Updated after each verification

## How to Use the Verification System

### For Developers

1. **Before Making Changes**
   - Check the component status dashboard to understand the current state
   - Review existing issues related to the component you're working on

2. **After Making Changes**
   - Update the status in tracking-progress.md
   - Run the Cypress tests to verify your changes
   - Update the verification checklist
   - Update the component status dashboard
   - Resolve any issues in the issue tracker

3. **When Finding Issues**
   - Add the issue to issues.md
   - Update the component status dashboard
   - Create a plan to fix the issue

### For Testers

1. **Running Automated Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   yarn test
   
   # Run specific tests
   yarn verify
   
   # Open Cypress UI
   yarn cypress:open
   ```

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Follow the verification checklist in verification.md
   - Update the status after testing
   - Document any issues in issues.md
