# Google Places API Integration

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating the Google Places API into the handyman-v2 project, ensuring seamless connectivity with the existing Supabase database.

## Overview

The Google Places API will be used to retrieve location-based data for handyman services, enhancing the application's ability to provide relevant service providers based on geographic location. This integration will allow us to:

1. Search for handyman services in specific locations
2. Retrieve detailed information about service providers
3. Store and manage this data in our Supabase database
4. Enrich existing profiles with additional location data

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Setup and Configuration

- [x] Ensure Google Maps API key is available in environment variables
- [ ] Create a Google Places API client utility
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism to reduce API calls
- [ ] Create rate limiting to prevent exceeding API quotas

### 2. API Integration

- [ ] Develop a Places API service module
- [ ] Create API endpoints for Places data retrieval
- [ ] Implement search functionality for businesses by location
- [ ] Add detailed place information retrieval

### 3. Database Integration

- [ ] Design database schema for storing Places API data
- [ ] Create Supabase tables and relationships
- [ ] Implement data synchronization between Places API and Supabase
- [ ] Add indexing for optimized location-based queries

### 4. User Interface Components

- [ ] Create location search components
- [ ] Develop map visualization for service providers
- [ ] Implement address autocomplete functionality
- [ ] Add distance-based filtering options

### 5. Testing and Optimization

- [ ] Create test cases for API integration
- [ ] Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Optimize API usage to minimize costs
- [ ] Ensure data consistency between Places API and Supabase

## Technical Specifications

### Google Places API Client

We will create a dedicated client for interacting with the Google Places API, following these specifications:

```typescript
// Key functionality:
// 1. Search for businesses by location and service type
// 2. Retrieve detailed place information
// 3. Implement caching to reduce API calls
// 4. Add rate limiting to prevent quota exhaustion
```

### Database Schema

The following tables will be added to our Supabase database:

1. `locations` - Stores geographic information
2. `service_areas` - Defines service coverage areas
3. `place_details` - Stores detailed information from Places API

### API Endpoints

We will implement the following API endpoints:

1. `/api/places/search` - Search for businesses by location and service type
2. `/api/places/details` - Get detailed information about a specific place
3. `/api/places/nearby` - Find nearby service providers

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Setup and configuration, create basic API client
2. **Week 2**: Implement database schema and integration
3. **Week 3**: Develop UI components and API endpoints
4. **Week 4**: Testing, optimization, and documentation

## Cost Considerations

To optimize costs when using the Google Places API:

1. Implement aggressive caching (6-month cache for stable data)
2. Use field masks to request only necessary data
3. Batch requests where possible
4. Implement fallback mechanisms for development/testing

## Security Considerations

1. Store API keys securely in environment variables
2. Implement server-side API calls to protect the API key
3. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Validate and sanitize all user inputs before making API calls
