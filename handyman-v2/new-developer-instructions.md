## Current CSS Issues and Troubleshooting

We're currently experiencing issues with CSS styling in the project. Here's what you need to know:

1. **CSS Integration Approach**:
   - We've created a script (`scripts/copy-template-css.js`) that copies CSS and font files from the original Envato template to the project
   - We've updated the `_app.js` file to import the template's CSS files
   - We've added SCSS support by installing the `sass` package
   - We've created an `index.scss` file that imports all necessary CSS files

2. **Current Issues**:
   - Some CSS styles are not being applied correctly
   - Font files might not be loading properly
   - The layout doesn't match the original template exactly

3. **Troubleshooting Steps**:
   - Compare the working HandymanServices template with our implementation
   - Check the CSS import order in `_app.js` and `index.scss`
   - Verify that all font files are correctly copied and referenced
   - Inspect the browser's developer tools to identify missing or conflicting styles
   - Consider using the `_document.js` approach to include CSS files directly in the HTML head

4. **Reference Implementation**:
   - The original HandymanServices template in `Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/HandymanServices` is working correctly
   - Use this as a reference for CSS structure and implementation

## Conversion Process
1. Review [CONVERSION_GUIDELINES.md](cci:7://file:///C:/Users/IvoD/repos/lead-gen-handyman/handyman-v2/CONVERSION_GUIDELINES.md)
2. Follow image replacement protocols

## Next Steps

1. **Fix CSS Issues**:
   - Complete the CSS integration by resolving the remaining styling issues
   - Ensure all font files are correctly referenced and accessible

2. **Component Implementation**:
   - Implement HeaderMenuContent.jsx
   - Update MobileMenu.jsx to match the template
   - Test the application to ensure it renders correctly

3. **MCP Integration**:
   - Integrate the MCP functionality from the 03-03-AddPSEOEnrichment branch
   - Focus on MCP Configuration, Utility Functions, and Components

By following these instructions, you should be well-equipped to start contributing to the Handyman v2 project.
