# Handyman Project - Next Steps

## Current Status (February 10, 2025)

### Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

-   **`handyman-v1`:** Contains the original Handyman v1 project. This project is a Next.js application with existing Supabase integration and other functionalities. It serves as a reference for the new project.
-   **`handyman-v2`:** Contains the new Handyman v2 project. This project is based on the "FindHouse" real estate template, which is a Next.js application. The goal is to adapt this template for the handyman service, integrate Supabase for database operations, and connect to OpenAI for features like enriched content generation.

    -   The actual Next.js application for `handyman-v2` is located within: `@handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template`

### Progress

-   **Folder Organization:** The project folders have been organized as requested, with `handyman-v1` and `handyman-v2` as sibling directories.
-   **FindHouse Template Setup:** Phase 1 (FindHouse Template Setup) has been completed. The FindHouse template is now set up and running locally.
-   **Supabase Client:** A Supabase client has been initialized in `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-fdkNKA8O-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse/utils/supabase/client.ts`.
-   **Environment Variables:** A `.env.local` file has been created in the `findhouse` directory with placeholder values for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. **These placeholders need to be replaced with the correct values for the Handyman v2 Supabase project.**
-   **AddTodo Component:** A basic `AddTodo` component (`AddTodo.jsx`) has been created in the `findhouse/components` directory. This component is currently integrated into the main `app/page.jsx` file.
-   **Basic Supabase Interaction:** The `app/page.jsx` file includes an `addTodo` function that attempts to insert data into a Supabase table named 'Todos'. **The existence and structure of this table in the Supabase database need to be verified and created if it doesn't exist.**
-   **Build and Run:** The `findhouse` project (Handyman v2) can be built (`npm run build`) and run in development mode (`npm run dev`) *after* installing dependencies.
-   **Dependencies:** The necessary dependencies `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@types/node` have been installed. However, there were dependency conflicts during installation, and `--legacy-peer-deps` was used to force the installation. This might need to be revisited.
-   **Project Documentation:** Created a central documentation file (`handyman-v2/documentation/handyman-v2-documentation.md`) outlining the project overview, URL structure, data model, template adaptation plan, technical implementation details, and future considerations.
-   **Adapted `data/properties.js`:** Updated the file to include handyman service data and use existing property images.
-   **Updated Global Filter:** Updated the keyword input and service category dropdown in `components/common/GlobalFilter.jsx`. Updated the "Amenities" section heading to "Specializations" and updated the options in the `CheckBoxFilter` component in `components/common/CheckBoxFilter.jsx`.
-   **Updated Hero Component:** Updated the Hero component to display a sample image and handyman-related text.
-   **Adapted Home page UI:**
    *   Created `FeaturedServices.jsx` and `FindServices.jsx` components to replace the real estate-focused components.
    *   Updated `components/home/index.jsx` to use the new `FeaturedServices` and `FindServices` components.
    *   Updated `data/findServices.js` with handyman service categories and images.
    *   Added comments to `public/assets/scss/main.css` to indicate where new CSS rules should be added.

### Next Steps

1. **Adapt the FindHouse Template:**
    *   Replace placeholder content with Handyman-specific content, referencing the data model and URL structure defined in the documentation.
    *   Customize the UI/UX to align with the Handyman brand and user experience goals.
    *   We are currently working on updating the images and content.

2. **Supabase Integration:**

**Note:** We have temporarily paused the Supabase integration to focus on building the base application. The following steps were taken for Supabase integration and will be revisited later:

-   A Supabase client has been initialized in `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-fdkNKA8O-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse/utils/supabase/client.ts`.
-   A `.env.local` file has been created in the `findhouse` directory with Supabase credentials.
-   A table named `testCrud` was created in the Supabase project.
-   Initial code for adding and fetching data from `testCrud` was added to `app/page.jsx` but has been reverted.

**Next Steps for Supabase (Later):**

1.  **Verify and Update Environment Variables:**
    *   Obtain the correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for the Handyman v2 Supabase project.
    *   Update the `.env.local` file within the `findhouse` directory with these correct values.

2.  **Supabase Database Setup:**
    *   Ensure that a Supabase project is set up for Handyman v2.
    *   Create tables for `businesses`, `cities`, `services`, etc.

3.  **Implement CRUD Operations:**
     *   Implement create, read, update, and delete operations for the core entities.

4.  **Refactor for Better Structure:**
    *   Move Supabase-related logic into separate files within the `utils/supabase` directory.
    *   Create a `types` directory for TypeScript types.

### Other Future Steps

1.  **Integrate with OpenAI:**
    *   Implement the OpenAI integration.

2.  **Address Dependency Conflicts:**
    *   Investigate the dependency conflicts.

3.  **Testing:**
    *   Write unit and integration tests.

4.  **Update `start-here.txt`:**
     *   Update to reflect project changes.
