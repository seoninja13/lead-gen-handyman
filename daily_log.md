# Daily Log

## 3/9/2025

- Implemented Envato template components for the handyman application:
  - Created and updated multiple components to match the Envato template structure:
    - Created PopupSignInUp.jsx for user authentication modal
    - Created Blogs.jsx for displaying blog articles
    - Created HeaderMenuContent.jsx for main navigation menu
    - Created MobileMenuContent.jsx for mobile navigation
    - Created WhyChoose.jsx to highlight service benefits
    - Created Partners.jsx to display partner logos
    - Created CallToAction.jsx for quote requests
    - Updated Hero.jsx to match the template structure
    - Updated the main index.tsx to incorporate all components
  
  - Added styling and configuration:
    - Created _app.js to properly import CSS and JavaScript dependencies
    - Created globals.css and components.css for styling
    - Set up Redux store for state management
    - Configured Bootstrap and FontAwesome integration
    - Organized image assets in the public directory

  - Encountered styling issues:
    - The UI is still not displaying correctly
    - Will need to investigate CSS paths and asset loading
    - May need to revert to a previous branch with working code

  - Updated documentation:
    - Added progress to tracking-progress.md
    - Documented component structure and implementation

  Next steps will involve resolving the styling issues by either fixing the current implementation or reverting to a working branch.

## 3/8/2025

- Updated the daily log with today's work:
  - Restored the original Envato template UI for the handyman application:
    - Analyzed the structure of the original Envato template and the HandymanServices template
    - Created necessary components based on the Envato template structure:
      - Added FeaturedServices.jsx to showcase handyman services
      - Added FindServices.jsx to display service areas
      - Added CallToAction.jsx for customer engagement
      - Added footer components (Footer.jsx, CopyrightFooter.jsx, Social.jsx, SubscribeForm.jsx)
      - Added MobileMenu.jsx for responsive navigation
      - Added WhyChoose.jsx and Partners.jsx components
    - Created a dedicated test page at `/test` to isolate testing functionality
    - Configured the project to use the Pages Router structure
    - Updated next.config.js and tsconfig.json to properly support path aliases
    - Created a temporary app/page.tsx to handle App Router redirection
    - Addressed build errors related to module resolution
    - Cleaned up Next.js cache to ensure proper rebuilding
  
  The main application now displays the handyman services UI based on the Envato template, while testing functionality is isolated to the `/test` route. This provides a better user experience and separates development tools from the customer-facing interface.
