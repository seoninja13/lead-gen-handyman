# Handyman v2 Project Plan of Action

## Previous Phases (Completed)

**Phase 1: Template Adaptation and Customization**
1. Explore the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse` directory to understand the structure of the FindHouse template.
2. Replace the placeholder content from the FindHouse real estate template with initial content relevant to handyman services.
3. Customize the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to better suit a handyman service website. This will involve modifying layouts, components, and styles.
4. Implement basic SEO (Search Engine Optimization) considerations during the template adaptation, such as updating meta descriptions and page titles.
5. Once the template is adapted, run the application to ensure the changes are correctly implemented and the basic handyman website structure is in place.

**Phase 2: Run Original FindHouse Application & Integrate Supabase**
1. Look for and read any documentation files within the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse` directory or in the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/documentation` directory to get setup instructions for the original FindHouse template.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for the FindHouse application by running `yarn install` in the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse` directory.
3. Start the original FindHouse application in development mode using the command `yarn dev` in the same `findhouse` directory and verify it is running correctly.
4. Define the database schema for Handyman v2 in Supabase, including tables for `businesses`, `cities`, `services`, etc., as needed for the handyman services website.
5. Integrate the Supabase client into the adapted FindHouse application to connect it to the Supabase database.
6. Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within the application to test and confirm that the Supabase integration is working correctly.

**Phase 3: Integrate OpenAI and Generate Content**
1. Integrate the OpenAI API client into the application.
2. Develop functions to generate relevant and engaging content for the handyman services website using the OpenAI API.
3. Integrate the OpenAI-generated content into the adapted FindHouse template to dynamically populate relevant sections of the website with enriched content.

## Current Phase (March 3, 2025)

**Phase 4: UI Restoration and Testing Isolation**

### Current Status
1. **Project Structure**
   - We've established the main project structure and documented it in the project rules
   - We're using the Pages Router pattern (not App Router) for the application
   - We've created necessary UI components based on the Envato template

2. **Configuration**
   - Updated next.config.js to set `appDir: false` to properly use the Pages Router
   - Added path aliases in tsconfig.json for better module resolution
   - Created a temporary app/page.tsx to handle redirections

3. **Components Created**
   - FeaturedServices.jsx for showcasing handyman services
   - FindServices.jsx for displaying service areas
   - CallToAction.jsx for customer engagement
   - Footer components (Footer.jsx, CopyrightFooter.jsx, Social.jsx, SubscribeForm.jsx)
   - MobileMenu.jsx for responsive navigation
   - WhyChoose.jsx and Partners.jsx components

4. **Testing Isolation**
   - Created a dedicated test page at `/test` to isolate testing functionality

### Action Plan

#### Step 1: Verify Current Implementation
- Run the application to verify that the home page displays the handyman services UI
- Check that the test functionality is properly isolated to the `/test` route
- Ensure all components are rendering correctly

#### Step 2: Complete Missing Components
- Review the Envato template to identify any missing components
- Implement any remaining components needed for a complete UI
- Ensure all components are properly styled and responsive

#### Step 3: Set Up Testing Infrastructure
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing
- Configure automated test runs after each feature addition
- Create basic test templates for components and utilities
- Implement CI pipeline to run tests automatically
- Begin writing unit tests for existing components

#### Step 4: Integrate Data Fetching
- Implement Supabase integration for data storage and retrieval
- Set up Google Places API for location services
- Create API endpoints for data operations
- Write unit tests for data fetching functions

#### Step 5: Implement SEO Optimization
- Create dynamic routes following the city-specific, service-oriented pattern
- Implement metadata for SEO optimization
- Set up proper URL structure (e.g., `/emergency-plumbing-repair-sacramento-ca`)
- Test SEO implementation with appropriate tools

#### Step 6: Testing and Debugging
- Expand unit test coverage for all components and functions
- Begin implementing end-to-end tests (WIP)
- Set up Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Debug any issues with component rendering or data fetching
- Ensure proper error handling throughout the application

#### Step 7: Performance Optimization
- Optimize component rendering and data fetching
- Implement caching strategies for API calls
- Ensure fast page load times
- Test performance with appropriate tools

#### Step 8: Documentation
- Update documentation with implementation details
- Document API endpoints and data structures
- Document testing strategies and procedures
- Create user guides for the application

#### Step 9: Deployment
- Prepare the application for production deployment
- Set up proper environment variables for production
- Ensure all tests pass before deployment
- Deploy the application to the production environment

### Next Immediate Steps

1. Run the application to verify the current implementation
2. Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing
3. Create basic test templates and start writing tests for existing components
4. Identify and fix any remaining issues with the UI components
5. Begin implementing data fetching from Supabase
