# Handyman v2 Project Plan of Action

**Phase 1: Template Adaptation and Customization**
1. Explore the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse` directory to understand the structure of the FindHouse template.
2. Replace the placeholder content from the FindHouse real estate template with initial content relevant to handyman services.
3. Customize the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to better suit a handyman service website. This will involve modifying layouts, components, and styles.
4. Implement basic SEO (Search Engine Optimization) considerations during the template adaptation, such as updating meta descriptions and page titles.
5. Once the template is adapted, run the application to ensure the changes are correctly implemented and the basic handyman website structure is in place.

**Phase 2: Run Original FindHouse Application & Integrate Supabase**
1. Look for and read any documentation files within the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse` directory or in the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/documentation` directory to get setup instructions for the original FindHouse template.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for the FindHouse application by running `yarn install` in the `handyman-v2/Envato-template-files/themeforest-findhouse-real-estate-react-nextjs-template/findhouse` directory.
3. Start the original FindHouse application in development mode using the command `yarn dev` in the same `findhouse` directory and verify it is running correctly.
4. Define the database schema for Handyman v2 in Supabase, including tables for `businesses`, `cities`, `services`, etc., as needed for the handyman services website.
5. Integrate the Supabase client into the adapted FindHouse application to connect it to the Supabase database.
6. Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within the application to test and confirm that the Supabase integration is working correctly.

**Phase 3: Integrate OpenAI and Generate Content**
1. Integrate the OpenAI API client into the application.
2. Develop functions to generate relevant and engaging content for the handyman services website using the OpenAI API.
3. Integrate the OpenAI-generated content into the adapted FindHouse template to dynamically populate relevant sections of the website with enriched content.
